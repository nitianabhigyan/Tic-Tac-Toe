# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic Tac toe game (A.K.A. Cross Zero) made in python3. The game supports both player vs player modes and computer vs player mode.
For the game to work properly make sure the correct fonts are installed in your system. If not just change them to any local font in your system. 
Enjoy :) 
The game should work on both Windows and Linux deployments, however it is not tested for LINUX deployments.
